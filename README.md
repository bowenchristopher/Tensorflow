# Tensorflow Converting Images to MNIST style np arrays
This repository contains code examples for converting small image datasets into python Numpy arrays which can be fed into machine learning systems as a toy alternative to the MNIST dataset.

This code uses python2.7 and TensorFlow 1.8.0

!!! This is by no means an effective or scalable way of handling image processing for anything more than a TOY network.!!!

This is simply code for quick and dirty results
